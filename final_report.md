The report should describe the “lessons learned”:

• How you organized your group

The various tasks varied in their ability to be split into subtasks. For the MLP and MSV classifiers, we decided to split into two groups,
in which each group member developed their own solution. During this, we cross-validated our results and exchanged methods. For the two 
following exercises, where such division of labor was not possible, we increased the amount of zoom-meetings to compensate for a less efficient
workflow. We didn't utilise the possibility to work on the same files using different branches as we do not feel as comfortable working
this way. Because of this, we created files with variations of the code and incorporated them into the main file. We also always screened
each others code before fitting it into the main file.

• What worked, what did not work

The large amount of meetings helped to verify where everyone was in their individual progress. Reviewing each others code so often helped
having a clear view on the way the code was constructed for every team member. 

• For each task:

• What is special about your solution

• What was your approach

• What worked, what did not work

• General thoughts about the group exercise
